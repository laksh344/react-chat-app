# React Firebase Chat Application

This project is a real-time chat application built with **React** and **Firebase**. It leverages Firebase's real-time database and authentication services to provide a seamless and responsive chat experience. The app allows users to sign in, send messages, and interact with each other in real time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Messages are instantly updated for all users in the chatroom using Firebase's real-time database.
- **Authentication**: Users can sign in using Firebase Authentication.
- **User Presence**: Users are notified when other users join or leave the chat.
- **Mobile Responsive**: The chat interface is responsive and can be used on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Message Persistence**: All chat messages are stored in Firebase, ensuring they persist across sessions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite
- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Authentication
- **Styling**: CSS (can be enhanced with frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Material-UI if needed)

```env
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### 4. Run the application
